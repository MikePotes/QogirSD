Qogir Slightly Different: GTK-Theme modification based on Qogir Gtk Theme by vinceliuice

I would like to thank vinceliuice for all his great contributions!

This is a theme for GTK, a modification of Qogir by vinceliuice, which is based on Arc by horst3180.
The theme was optimized for use with Xfce and it has not been testet with other linux desktops.
Actually, the theme was simply adapted to my personal preference and initially not designed for a wide userbase.
Just like to share it with users that have similar preferences. 
It features a mixture of dark rounded dialogs with light colored and square cornered windows.
A compositior is required, my preference is picom.
The modifications mainly affect /gtk-3.0/gtk.css. Color changes have been introduced using global color
definitions, so it is quite easy to change colors.
